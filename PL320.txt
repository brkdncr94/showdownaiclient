Syntax
	Constraints on how to combine elements to derive some larger meaningful unit
	Grammar != meaning  (just because a sentence is well formed doesn't mean it makes sense) (a poorly formed sentence can still make sense)
	A lot of our knowledge about grammar and stuff is implicit
		You can demonstrate that you can do it, but it's hard to describe why or how
	The order of words in sentences is variable
		BUT, the elements generally stay intact
			Elements being certain sets/combinations of words
		These elements are called CONSTITUENTS
	How you organize these consituents are called PHRASE STRUCTURE RULES
	Constituents
		For example, noun phrases
			determinant, modifier, subject (the red book)
		Can be tested by seeing if it makes sense in different places
			topicalization
				move the constituent to the front of the sentence
			coordination
				pair it with another noun phrase
				does the constituent have to maintain its form to make sense?
			Possible answer to a question
				does the element have to maintain its form to be a valid answer to a question?

	NP Phrase structure rule - rules for building the constituents
		X -> Y  An X can be expressed as Y
			That is, Y is a valid X
		Parentheses means is optional
		NP -> (Det) (Adj) N (P NP)
	
	Rules have to generate all of the constituents in a language
	Phrases are subject to the same tests (topicalization, coordination, possible answer to a question)
	
	Verb phrases need some additional work for coordination
		a reflexive pronoun can act as NP for generating a VP
		
	VP -> V (NP) (PP)
		PP is a prepositional phrase
	
	PP -> P (NP)
	
	You can turn language phrases into trees
	There's a compelling argument for expression as binary trees
	
		 VP
	   /  \  \
	  V   NP   PP
	
	     VP
		/ 	\
	  V		  /  \
			NP   PP
	
	Look up syntax stuff on adjuncts and arguments, and rewrite rules and trasformative rules
	
	Not everything can be expressed in a phrase structure
		"I believe the earth is flat"
		
	Note: The rules above are just a toy mini-grammar
	
	An established structural system implies the existence of a parsing mechanism
		Tests to see if a string or text can be reduced to logical syntactic forms, and that they conform to the established logical grammar
		
	In PL, this also means converting a sequence of words and attempts to generate some sort of structural representation, like a parse trees
	
	Interpretation of an expression depends on its grammatical analysis
		ambiguous sentences can be structured different ways, and they can be interpreted different ways
		"John bought the book for susan"
			John bought and gave the book to susan -> PP is an argument to VP
			John bought the book that was originally intended for susan -> PP is an argument to NP
			Two different possible tree structures
		Di-transitive verbs take two arguments
			both NP and PP
	
	Structure can ultimately define meaning
